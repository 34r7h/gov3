# gov3
As times change, our systems of organization need to evolve. With the various breakthroughs in computing (internet, machine learning, crypto-technologies), it may be time to rethink how government should be used and organized. This is a sandbox implementation of a constitutional convention. Purely theoretical.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to derive a new constitution for the people of various nations that reflects cultural interests and technological capabilities. The goal is an organizational technology that fosters the creation of world peace and security through public transparancy, immediate response times, and efficient distribution of resources.

Traditional concerns of nations should be addressed, namely sovereignty of the state -- "the power of a state to do everything necessary to govern itself, such as making, executing, and applying laws; imposing and collecting taxes; making war and peace; and forming treaties or engaging in commerce with foreign nations."

## Format
This document will be comprised of various files that address specific concerns, issues, powers, and limitations. During this initial phase, we're focusing on a decentralized blob of concerns and interests in the branch, "[concerns-interests](https://github.com/irthos/gov3/tree/concerns-interests)". We'll turn attention to organizing topics in a later phase.

## Participation

## Background

### Self Determination
Essentially, the right to self-determination is the right of a people to determine its own destiny. In particular, the principle allows a people to choose its own political status and to determine its own form of economic, cultural and social development. [UNPO - Self Determination](http://www.unpo.org/article/4957 "Self-determination")

### State Building
The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) determined that basic state capacities are to:
- Assist in the acquisition of new technologies
- Mobilize and channel resources to productive sectors
- Enforce standards and regulations
- Establish social pacts
- Fund deliver and regulate services and social programmes

States must be able to create:
- Political Capacity to address the extent to which the necessary coalitions or political settlements can be built
- Resource Mobilization Capacity to generate resources for investment and social development
- Allocate Resources To Productive And Welfare-Enhancing Sectors
